<h1 align="center">Welcome to PC-Setup ðŸ‘‹</h1>

## What is this?
`PC-Setup` is a script which reinstalls all your Windows 10 apps using Chocolatey, the Package Manager for Windows.
You just need to download and unzip this repo, rename the `config.example.bat` to `config.bat`, fill it, and run your `install.bat` file. Also, make sure that the app you are trying to install is available [here](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages).

**Disclaimer:** This app indirectly modifies your PC's Registry which can be harmful. Fortunately, we create a System Restore Point just before we start, so that we can revert back easily.

This script also sets your BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) Dump Files to the `MiniDump` option, so its easy for you to debug and fix them ;)

PS:- If you're a fan of [Cmder](https://cmder.net/) and [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), this app automatically installs Cmder and FFmpeg for you, including the Environment Variables.

## TL;DR
You can do anything with this as long as you credit/mention me for it. 

Oh, and you can't sue me if it blows up
