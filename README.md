### This can now be considered STABLE and can be used to install your PC apps. This can even install FFmpeg and Cmder, if the folders are already installed and the location is specified. (FFmpeg installation folders are no longer neccessary.)

You can read the Comments in each file, and know what it does :_) Enjoy

> Just an app that sets up your PC Apps and Environment variables after a reset.

Disclaimer: Works on Windows 10, unless your Registry is broken. 
> Should work on Windows 8, 7 (Untested)

## Usage
Download this repo and unzip it.
Rename `config.example.bat` to `config.bat` and fill the file.
Run the install.bat File

## Prerequisites
Install Cmder (If needed)<br>
~~Install FFmpeg (If needed)~~ No longer needed, thanks to an idea from [SpeckyYT](https://github.com/SpeckyYT/) and [BlackWolfWoof](https://github.com/BlackWolfWoof)<br>
None, not even Nodejs. Just a PC is enough.

# How it works?
Basically, when you set your config in the `config.bat` file, and run the `install.bat` file, it first installs Chocolatey. [Chocolatey/Choco](https://chocolatey.org/) is a package manager for Windows, like `APT` in Ubuntu and `Homebrew` in Mac. Then, Choco loops through the array you set in the config file. (Allows up to 14 packages.)

# Backup
As you know, I'm not responsible if this blows up, as per the [LICENSE](https://github.com/WickedWizard3588/PC-Setup/blob/master/LICENSE). So, you might want to take a whole Registry Backup (Not recommended) or a Backup of your just ENV Variables. 

If neither options seem nice, you can create a System Restore Point to restore back easily. 

> This might be integrated into the Project later

## TL;DR
You can do anything with this as long as you credit/mention me for it. 

Oh, and you can't sue me if it blows up
